      Literally just like taking a Xanax or Ativan. 

Contains the exact same ingredients of pain killers, anxiety pills, and sleep pills all rolled into a brown capsule of dried plant.

It's wonderful for anxiety and insomnia- but it's not something to play with!As a man, I noticed a great upgrade in my libido. More energy during my day. With a higher dose, I can definetly feel the substance in my body giving me energy to go through the day. Also take during a meal to avois stomach upset. Did not notice a change in my anxiety however, I think? Try it for yourself, everyone's body reacts differently.After three days I went from high blood pressure to low. I had to cut my blood pressure pills in half. But I will mention I was also dieting and working out more. And I have lost a few pounds. IF I can get off blood pressure altogether, that would be awesome.on my 3rd bottle (90 caps of 450 mg) usually i take twice daily one after breakfast/lunch and one after dinner . Taking 3 times when needed.

i struggle with high anxiety , uncontrolled anger esp. during PMS and also insomnia

This helped me alot. centered my emotions, clearer mindset, more focused, helped to be more calm and collected when confronted with triggering situations and sleep was better

no other side effects noted in my experience ( with maximum dose of 450 mg x 3 daily )I've found this supplement extremely effective. So much so that I only take two tablets when I want novel effects for just one day. The most noticeable effect is a quieting of the mind. I feel more sleepy, more comfy, but not tiered, not low energy, just cool and collected â everything comes to me in a timely manner and I want to cuddle people.

My satisfaction is somewhat lower than the effectiveness as though it clearly has a good effect on anxiety, it also decreases my desire to talk and share passionately â which I also love. So though it makes me very comfortable in the room with many people, I cease to be life of the party â though that wasn't happening anyway.

I simply reserve this analog for when I want a different colour spilled over the day. A fantastic novel effect which can help stimulate the fulfilment of your week.Read More Read Less  I tried a 150mg ksm-66 gummy. I ate it around 4:30pm. By 5:15 I was feeling some heaviness in my chest and my legs were more wobbly than with my everyday anxiety. By 6:30 I had lost my appetite, felt shaky, and had been in my bathroom peeing for 45minutes. Its now 915 and I feel nausea (been feeling like I was going to puke at any moment) and feeling a little more tired from it all. Hopefully I will get over all this soon!I have been taking it for about 3 months and it has had the most amazing effect on treating my chronic anxiety and burnout. I have started by taking 800mg/day and now I can do with 400mg/day. I have suggested it to everyone I know and all of them speak highly of it, as if it's some kind of miracle treatment. Well, for me it is! 

Just a FYY, if you have gastrointestinal issues such as acid reflux, gerd, stomach ulcers, you might want to take only 400mg/day and on a full stomach, otherwise it might cause some discomfort. 
Not sure about taking it longterm, I haven't had issues with it and I know someone that's been taking it for over a year with the same positive results. Might just be a case of "there are not any proper long-term studies on its effects". Good luck!Read More Read Less  these gummies made me so sick. I've been throwing up at night within an hour of taking them.I started supplementing with a powder in my coffee, in an attempt to help balance my body from an array of symptoms relating to hormonal imbalance when recovering from stopping hormonal birth control nearly 2 years ago. I took a powder from a health food store. Unfortunately it has taken me over a year to connect the dots and realize the ashwaghanda I incorporated into my natural treatments was then the culprit of some of the very symptoms I was trying to combat. Namely: low/no sex drive, being completely emotionally numb, extreme fatigue, debililtating brainfog. I will say it can lower anxiety, but along with this lowers my ability to feel any emotion at all and during acute stage I felt like a complete zombie, and had zero motivation. This affects so many hormones (is GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, affects your sex hormones, drastically lowers cortisol) The strong effect on all of this resulted in persistent and impactful imbalance eg: you really, really need cortisol..at the correct levels, to feel motivated and content emotionally) Yes I cycled it, and took half a teaspoon on the days I had it, a common recommendation. It wasn't til I restocked and commenced a new cycle nearly every day for 3 weeks (in January this year) that I noticed something was really, really wrong.. It does not work well with my, and many others' bodies. I have now been 2.5 months off so far and the extreme fatigue, brainfog, demotivation, and feeling dead inside have subsided (they were practically debilitating and I have lost a lot of my life to this supplement making me sick). I am becoming much more alert, my menstrual cycle is no longer extremely short like 21 days, I still can't feel all my emotions, nor is my sex drive working and that is significant, beyond having sex. Sexual energy is a life force, the feeling of embodiment. Whereas I am dissociated. I am 30 and know myself very, very well and this is distinctly an imbalance my body/brain are trying to recover from- my thoughts themselves are not negative. I literally can't feel my emotions. This really is not for everyone, please be careful and know that as an ayurvedic herb act very differently on each person depending on their energetic/biological make up and it would be best assessed and monitored by a qualified practitioner of herbal medicine. The consistency of use may also vary a lot per person, IF you're suited to use it, Too many people take this with bare minimum information. It is a drug, and it can have significant, lasting effects that are very detrimental. Be very carefulRead More Read Less  Took 1 concentrated 125 mg dose. Within 12 hours I began having a pretty bad stomach ache. 5 hours later I was throwing up. I couldnât sleep that night because my heart rate was abnormally high. 0/10 do not recommend, or at least, be very cautiousI was having a slight case of Anxiety due to job related issues, so I decided to look up a mood enhancing suplement online. That's when I ran into a company selling Ashwagandha on Amazon. The first day I took this I did not feel anything at all. It sort of reminded me of St. John Wort the bottle which has been sitting on my shelf for 5 years with minimal use except as a Placebo. In any case, I didn't want to give up, so I took it for another few days. By the 4th day my Anxiety had become more accute. I also had problems sleeping. It was like my mind was racing and I could not crontrol the recurring thoughts. I actually felt Synapses and Neurons going off in my brain like a July 4th fire-works celebration ! This is the second (and definitely the last time time) I had this reaction with Ashwagandha. At least the St Johns Wort didn't keep me from sleeping. This supplement is just not for me ..

When taken anxiety level is greatly reduced.BEWARE OF ASHWAGANDHA if you have autoimmune issues or take blood pressure medication.  I spent 1 1/2 years suffering long haul covid symptoms of light headedness and fatigue but finally got better.  Many supplements that I've been taking may have helped me.  I received a free, unsolicited bottle of Ashwagandha in the mail from a supplier of another supplement that I was using.  I happened to open the package at the time I was taking my other supplements so thought that I would try it.  Within fifteen minutes of taking it, I got light headed and this lasted through the day and now into the next morning as I write this. I also have fatigue.  I later saw on WebMD that you should avoid Ashwagandha if you have autoimmune issues or take blood pressure medication (which both apply to me).  I am very concerned that Ashwagandha has resurrected my long haul covid symptoms and dearly hope that this is just temporary.Read More Read Less  While it may be a placebo effect, I do feel different after starting a daily regime of 4400mg of Ashwagandha in gummy form along with regular daily vitamins and my daily prescribed 80mg of Adderal. I did experience stomach discomfort at the end of the first week at a 4400mg dosage, reduced it to a 2200mg daily dosage for 7 days, which eliminated the stomach problems, then returned to 4400mg without further problems. I feel clearer, more positive, and more energized with the Ashwagandha supplementing my Rx and daily vitamins, and I do notice a difference if I skip them in the morning.

At the time with ashwaganda 
Started taking ashwaganda for anxiety, after 3 weeks of use I sleep much better, my hormones got much better, even my blood pressure, Iâm 42 years old tried to get pregnant for years and after I started taking it with 42 I got pregnant, crazy , but I know was the ashwaganda Caused me extreme nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Started with capsules 3000 MG, thought it must be too high dosage. Switched to 1500 MG gummies, same effect.  I am unable to tolerate it.I started very slowly on liquid ashwaganda, just a few drops. We were boating and heading into a remote area. Just a few drops and my anxious thoughts disappeared. I was able to enjoy myself. I have been adjusting my dosage up over a few years. I love the liquid for instant results, but have started taking Herbamama capsules 750 mg for longer lasting effects. (Amazon) I am able to travel and not be anxious. Life changing for me. I do find that I am not as sharp when taking Ashwaganda, so I only take as needed, not everyday. I love that I can rely on a natural remedy and not prescription drugs. No side effects, havenât had a bad experience.Read More Read Less  Could this be serotonin syndrome? Iâve been having trouble falling asleep lately despite meds Iâve taken for a long time for depression/anxiety, so decided to try adding Ashwaganda, since it was reported to calm a racing mind. Took 300 mg in gummy form (Walgreens), and itâs had the OPPOSITE effect. I feel anxious, jittery, my mind wonât stop racing and Iâve barely had 2 hrs sleep in 48 hours. I wonder if it interacts with my SSRI to cause serotonin syndrome? Iâm stopping it right away and hope it clears my system soon so I can get some sleep! Be very cautious with this if you are taking other meds for psychiatric conditions.Read More Read Less   Do you know your vitamin ABCs?  Ease hot flashes and other symptoms.  Are you getting enough?

Some research suggests this herb may help people with conditions like anxiety and infertility, but stronger studies are needed.Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, which is a traditional form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.People have used ashwagandha for thousands of years to relieve stress, increase energy levels, and improve concentration.“Ashwagandha” is Sanskrit for “smell of the horse,” which refers to both the herb’s scent and its potential ability to increase strength.Its botanical name is Withania somnifera, and it’s also known by several other names, including “Indian ginseng” and “winter cherry.”The ashwagandha plant is a small shrub with yellow flowers that’s native to India and Southeast Asia. People use extracts or powder from the plant’s root or leaves to treat a variety of conditions, including anxiety and fertility issues.Here are 8 potential benefits of ashwagandha, based on research.Ashwagandha is perhaps best known for its ability to reduce stress. It’s classified as an adaptogen, a substance that helps the body cope with stress.Ashwagandha may help control mediators of stress, including heat shock proteins (Hsp70), cortisol, and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK-1). It also reduces the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system in your body that regulates the stress response.Research suggests Ashwagandha supplements may help relieve stress and anxiety.In a small study with 58 participants, those who took 250 or 600 mg of ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks had significantly reduced perceived stress and levels of the stress hormone cortisol compared with those who took a placebo.Those who took the ashwagandha supplements also saw improvements in sleep quality compared with the placebo group.Another study in 60 people found that those who took 240 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 60 days had significant reductions in anxiety compared with those who received a placebo treatment. Thus, early research suggests ashwagandha may be a helpful supplement for stress and anxiety.However, a 2021 review of studies concluded that there’s not enough evidence to form a consensus on the most appropriate dosage and form of ashwagandha for treating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety. Ashwagandha may be effective for reducing stress and anxiety symptoms. However, more research is needed to form a consensus on appropriate forms and dosing to address stress and stress-related disorders. Research has shown that ashwagandha may have beneficial effects on athletic performance and may be a worthwhile supplement for athletes. One analysis of research included 12 studies in people who took ashwagandha doses between 120 mg and 1,250 mg per day. The results suggest the herb may enhance physical performance, including strength and oxygen use during exercise.Another analysis that looked at five studies found that taking ashwagandha significantly enhanced maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) in healthy adults and athletes.VO2 max is the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use during intense activity. It’s a measurement of heart and lung fitness.Having optimal VO2 max is important for athletes and nonathletes alike. Low VO2 max is associated with increased mortality risk, while higher VO2 max is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.Additionally, ashwagandha may help increase muscle strength.In a 2015 study, male participants who took 600 mg of ashwagandha per day and participated in resistance training for 8 weeks had significantly greater gains in muscle strength and size compared with a placebo group.Ashwagandha may help improve measures of physical performance in athletes and healthy adults, including VO2 max and strength.Some evidence suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of other mental health conditions, including depression, in certain populations.In one study, researchers looked at the effects of ashwagandha in 66 people with schizophrenia who were experiencing depression and anxiety.They found that participants who took 1,000 mg of ashwagandha extract daily for 12 weeks had greater reductions in depression and anxiety than those who took a placebo.Limited research from 2013 also suggests that ashwagandha may help improve cognitive impairment in people with bipolar disorder.A 2021 review concluded that ashwaghanda may help manage depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other mental health-related and neurological issues.However, more research is needed into all these uses.The limited research available suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of depression and benefit people with some mental health conditions. However, more research is needed.Ashwagandha supplements have been shown in some studies to benefit male fertility and increase testosterone levels. In one study, 43 males aged 40–70 with overweight and mild fatigue took tablets containing ashwagandha extract or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. The treatment was associated with an 18% greater increase in DHEA-S, a sex hormone involved in testosterone production. Participants who took the herb also had a 14.7% greater increase in testosterone than those who took the placebo.Additionally, a review of four studies found that ashwagandha treatment significantly increased sperm concentration, semen volume, and sperm motility in males with low sperm count.It also increased sperm concentration and motility in males with normal sperm count.However, more studies are needed.Ashwagandha may help increase testosterone levels and may have some potential benefits for male fertility. However, more research is needed.Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may have some benefits for people with diabetes or high blood sugar levels.A review of 24 studies, including 5 clinical studies in people with diabetes, found that treatment with ashwagandha significantly reduced blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, blood lipids, and oxidative stress markers. The reason may be that certain compounds within ashwagandha — including one called withaferin A (WA) — have powerful antidiabetic activity and may help stimulate cells to take in glucose from the bloodstream.However, research is limited at this time, and more well-designed studies are needed.Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may reduce blood sugar levels through its effects on insulin secretion and cells’ ability to absorb glucose from the bloodstream.Ashwagandha contains compounds, including WA, that may help reduce inflammation in the body.Animal studies have shown that WA may also help reduce levels of inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and there’s some evidence ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in humans too.In a 2021 study, researchers gave people with COVID-19 an Ayurvedic drug containing 0.5 grams of ashwagandha and other herbs twice per day for 7 days. This reduced participants’ levels of inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α compared with a placebo.The treatment formulation also contained:However, research on ashwagandha’s potential effects on inflammation remain limited. Ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in the body. However, more research is needed.Taking ashwagandha may benefit cognitive function.One review of five clinical studies found early evidence that ashwagandha could improve cognitive functioning in certain populations, including older adults with mild cognitive impairment and people with schizophrenia.Cognitive functions it may benefit included:A study in 50 adults showed that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 8 weeks led to significant improvements in the following measures compared with taking a placebo:The researchers noted that compounds found in ashwagandha, including WA, have antioxidant effects in the brain, which may benefit cognitive health.However, more research is needed before experts can draw strong conclusions. Ashwagandha supplements may improve memory, reaction time, and the ability to perform tasks in certain populations. However, more research is needed.Many people take ashwagandha to promote restful sleep, and some evidence suggests it may help with sleep issues.For example, a study in 50 adults ages 65–80 found that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha root per day for 12 weeks significantly improved sleep quality and mental alertness upon waking compared with a placebo treatment. Additionally, one review of five high quality studies found that ashwagandha appeared to: The results were more pronounced in people with insomnia and in those who took more than 600 mg daily for 8 weeks or longer.Recent evidence suggests that ashwagandha may be an effective natural remedy to improve sleep and may especially help people with insomnia.Ashwagandha is likely safe for most people when used for up to 3 months, although its long-term effects are unknown.However, ashwagandha may not be safe if a person: Some people using ashwagandha supplements have reported the following adverse effects:Ashwagandha’s effects may not be immediate, and you may have to take it for several months before noticing its effects. Always speak with a doctor to ensure ashwagandha or other supplements are safe for you to use.Dosing recommendations for ashwagandha vary. For example, research has shown doses ranging from 250–1,250 mg per day to to be effective for different conditions. Consult a healthcare professional if you have questions regarding ashwagandha dosing. You can take ashwagandha in many ways, in either a single dose or multiple doses per day. And you can take it either with meals or on an empty stomach.How much ashwagandha can you take per day? Find out more.Although ashwagandha is safe for most people, it’s not safe for everyone. It’s important to check with a healthcare professional before taking ashwagandha to ensure it’s safe for you and that you use a safe dose.Possible benefits of ashwagandha include:The effects of ashwagandha will take time to appear, so a healthcare professional may recommend taking one dose daily. However, the long-term effects are unknown, and experts only recommend using it for up to 3 months. Ashwagangandha may not be safe:Always check with a healthcare professional before using ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb with various possible health benefits.Study findings suggest that it may help reduce anxiety and stress, support restful sleep, and even improve cognitive functioning in certain populations.Ashwagandha is likely safe for most people in the short term. However, it’s not appropriate for everyone, so it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before adding ashwagandha to your routine.Try this today: Here are more ideas to help you reduce stress:Read this article for more ways to reduce stress and anxiety.

Many studies show that taking ashwagandha daily can increase testosterone, but there isn't a clinical agreement on dosage. Let's look deeper. Both Ashwagandha and CBD have gotten a lot of press as natural healers. Let's see if the science backs up their claims.Ashwagandha is usually used to treat anxiety, but some people may have an adverse reaction that causes anxiety. Let's look deeper: Ashwagandha is a supplement that may help you sleep better. Corn silk is the long, silky threads that grow on corncobs. This article explains everything you need to know about corn silk, including its uses…OUR BRANDSThe recommended dosage for ashwagandha can vary depending on your needs, but most research suggests that taking 250–500 milligrams (mg) per day for at least 1 month may be beneficial.Ashwagandha, also known by its botanical name Withania somnifera, is a small woody plant with yellow flowers native to India and North Africa.It’s classified as an adaptogen, as it’s believed to help your body manage stress better. The plant — particularly its root — has been used for over 3,000 years as a natural Ayurvedic remedy against various ailments (1).Modern science also links it to health benefits, such as reduced stress and anxiety and improved blood sugar levels, mood, and memory.This article reviews the optimal dosages needed to reap different health benefits. Ashwagandha is best known for its stress-lowering effects. The medicinal herb appears to help lower levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by your adrenal glands in response to stress.More specifically, daily doses of 225–600 mg for 1–2 months have been shown to significantly lower cortisol levels (2, 3, 4).Moreover, one review reported that taking at least 600 mg of ashwagandha per day for 8 weeks could reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in people with stress or insomnia (5).Ashwagandha seems effective at lowering symptoms of stress and anxiety. Most benefits are linked to dosages of 225–600 mg per day taken for 1–2 months.Ashwagandha may also lower blood sugar levels — both in people with and without diabetes (6, 7).In one 2013 study in 25 people, ashwagandha reduced fasting blood sugar levels three times more than a placebo after 4 weeks (8).In another older study in people with type 2 diabetes, an ashwagandha supplement taken for 30 days helped lower fasting blood sugar levels as effectively as oral diabetes medication (9).Dosages used in these studies varied between 250 mg to 3 grams (g) and were generally split into 2–3 equal doses spread evenly over the day.Ashwagandha may help lower blood sugar levels. Benefits appear to start at dosages as little as 250 mg per day.Ashwagandha may help boost fertility and promote reproductive health, especially in males (10).In a 2010 in 75 males experiencing infertility, 5 g of ashwagandha daily increased sperm count and motility over a 3-month period (11).In another older study in highly stressed men, 5 g of ashwagandha per day also led to improved sperm quality. Moreover, by the end of the 3-month study, 14% of their partners had become pregnant (12).Other older studies report similar results with comparable dosages (13, 14).Taking 5 g of ashwagandha per day may boost fertility in males in as little as 3 months. Supplementing with ashwagandha may also increase muscle mass and strength.In one study, taking 500 mg of ashwagandha extract led to a significant increase in upper and lower body strength when paired with resistance training over a 12-week period (15).In another 2015 study in males, taking 600 mg of ashwagandha per day for 8 weeks led to a 1.5–1.7 times larger increase in muscle strength and 1.6–2.3 times higher increase in muscle size, compared to a placebo (13).Similar effects were observed with 750–1,250 mg of ashwagandha per day taken for 30 days (7).Daily doses of 500 mg of ashwagandha may provide small increases in muscle mass and strength in as little as 8 weeks. While most studies have focussed on men, some research suggests women may reap the same benefits.Ashwagandha may also help lower inflammation and boost your immunity.Older research shows that 12 milliliters (mL) of ashwagandha root extract per day may increase levels of immune cells (16).Another study found that taking 60 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 1 month improved the body’s natural and adaptive immune function, which could help protect against infection (17).Moreover, one older study showed that taking 250–500 mg of ashwagandha over 60 days may reduce C-reactive protein levels by up to 30%, which is a marker of inflammation (18).Ashwagandha may lower inflammation and help protect against infection. Supplements containing at least 250 mg of ashwagandha or 12 mL of ashwagandha extract appear to offer the most benefits.Ashwagandha is traditionally used in Ayurveda to help boost memory, and some scientific studies support this practice.For instance, in a small, 8-week study, taking 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract twice a day improved general memory, attention, and task performance significantly more than a placebo (19).In another study, taking 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract daily led to significant improvements in memory and focus after 90 days in adults with high stress levels (20).That being said, human research in this area is limited and more is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn. Consuming 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract per day may boost various aspects of memory. However, more studies are needed to confirm these effects.Ashwagandha is considered safe for most people. However, pregnant or breastfeeding people and individuals with autoimmune diseases — such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis — may need to avoid it (17, 21).Ashwagandha may also interact with certain medications. Therefore, people taking other medications should consult with a doctor before supplementing with ashwagandha (22).Keep in mind that most of the studies on ashwagandha were small and of low quality. For this reason, the information on the effectiveness and safety of dosages may be inaccurate. More research is needed.Ashwagandha is considered safe for most people. However, pregnant or breastfeeding people, individuals with autoimmune disorders, and those taking certain medications may need to avoid it.Ashwagandha is a medicinal herb that may offer several health benefits, such as improved blood sugar, inflammation, mood, memory, stress, and anxiety, as well as a boost in muscle strength and fertility. Dosages vary depending on your needs, but 250–500 mg per day for at least 1 month seem effective.

OUR BRANDSAdaptogens are substances that work to reduce the negative effects of stress on your body. They may help improve your body’s resistance to stress and offer other benefits as well. But which ones really work?The term “adaptogen” was first used in 1940 to describe certain plant-based extracts that can non-specifically enhance the human body.Nowadays, adaptogens refer to a range of naturally sourced and synthetic supplements that may help the body adapt to stressful situations by interfering with the fight or flight response and — in theory — without causing any harm. They may also help reduce the risk and impact of long-term stress.“Adaptogen” is a functional term. The term focuses on how these substances affect your body rather than what chemicals they contain. Adaptogens are widely available as supplements, but it’s best to check with a doctor before using either plant-based or synthetic adaptogens, as they may not be safe for everyone.Read on to find out what adaptogens are, how they work in the body, and whether or not they’re worth considering for you.Adaptogens come as either synthetic or plant-based compounds. They contain biologically active compounds, including phytochemicals, that can benefit the body. According to the original definition, they had to meet three criteria:Over time, the criteria have been refined. In the 1990s, some scientists defined them as follows: “Adaptogens are natural bioregulators that increase the ability to adapt environmental factors and avoid the damage caused by those factors.”In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined adaptogens as “A new kind of metabolic regulator that has been proved to help in environmental adaptation and to prevent external harms.”Examples of naturally occurring plant-based adaptogens include extracts from:Adaptogens contain plant compounds such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and coumarins.Adaptogens work by affecting certain body tissues and organs to reduce stress and fatigue and restore the body’s natural balance, especially when you’re under pressure. For example, ginseng affects the pituitary and adrenal glands. As a result, it may help reduce problems with sleep, arthritis, energy levels, and the nervous system.Examples of synthetic adaptogens include: Synthetic adaptogens can boost mental and physical and mental resistance, increase blood flow by expanding the blood vessels, and lower levels of sugar and lactate in the blood.In the past, athletes used them to help boost their stamina. However, some are now banned substances for athletes. People take adaptogens to help their bodies adapt to life’s stresses. Adaptogens aim to help your body react to or recover from both short- and long-term physical or mental stress. Some may also boost immunity and overall well-being. Scientists say they can “non-specifically enhance the resistance of the human body under a wide range of external circumstances.” In other words, they may help you cope when things get tough.Some research shows adaptogens can combat fatigue, enhance mental performance, ease depression and anxiety, and help you thrive rather than just muddle through.Proponents say adaptogens can boost overall health and specifically help people with: Although more research is needed, some studies suggest that certain adaptogens may have anticancer activities.When you face a physical or mental stressor, your body goes through a process known as general adaptation syndrome (GAS). GAS is a three-stage response: Adaptogens help you stay in the resistance phase longer, via a stimulating effect that holds off the exhaustion. Instead of crashing during a stressful moment, task, or event, you find a balance and carry on. Adapting to stress helps you perform and feel better despite the situation. And that helps improve your health and well-being. When stressed, your adrenal gland releases the stress hormone cortisol, which gives you the energy to tackle an emergency. But frequent releases of high levels of cortisol are not helpful. It may lead to cortisol dysfunction, which can trigger widespread inflammation and pain.Using adaptogens can help manage stress in the short term, but it may also help reduce the risk of long-term complications of persistent stress. Each adaptogen has a different effect on the body, so the choice of which one to take will depend on the result you seek. Ashwagandha, for example, can both energize and relax you. Here are some more examples: Adaptogens can have a powerful effect, so it’s essential to follow the instructions when using them.A naturopathic physician can recommend specific adaptogens and reputable formulas and dosages. They can also adjust your dosage as needed based on the effects you hope to achieve.Always check with a doctor before taking adaptogens or any type of supplement. They can interact with medications and may not be suitable for everyone.It’s also essential to check with a doctor before using supplements if you are pregnant or may become pregnant or if you are breastfeeding. Some supplements, including adaptogens, may harm a developing fetus or infant. A doctor may recommend using adaptogens for a few days or weeks to get through a busy time at work or taking them for a longer stretch if necessary. Some adaptogens take several weeks to have an effect. Adaptogens may help you get through intense periods — like holidays, finals, and taxes — and stay gently energized long term. However, they are not a substitute for looking after yourself through diet, exercise, and getting enough sleep. If you’re feeling anxious and overwhelmed or you have signs of depression lasting more than 2 weeks, it’s best to see a doctor about more robust options that can help. As with any drug or supplement, adaptogens do have side effects, interactions, and contraindications. So do your research, especially regarding any current health conditions. It’s also recommended you contact a healthcare professional before beginning a herbal regimen.

The root and berry are used to make medicine.

Ashwagandha has a lot of uses. But so far, there isn't enough information to judge whether it is effective for any of them.

Ashwagandha is used for arthritis, anxiety, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), balance, trouble sleeping (insomnia), tumors, tuberculosis, asthma, a skin condition marked by white patchiness (leukoderma), bronchitis, backache, fibromyalgia, menstrual problems, hiccups, Parkinson's disease, and chronic liver disease. It is also used to reduce side effects of medications used to treat cancer and schizophrenia. Ashwagandha is used to reduce levels of fat and sugar in the blood.

Ashwagandha is also used as an "adaptogen" to help the body cope with daily stress, and as a general tonic.
 
Some people also use ashwagandha for improving thinking ability, decreasing pain and swelling (inflammation), and preventing the effects of aging. It is also used for fertility problems in men and women and also to increase sexual desire.

Ashwagandha is applied to the skin for treating wounds, backache, and one-sided paralysis (hemiplegia).

The name Ashwagandha is from the Sanskrit language and is a combination of the word ashva, meaning horse, and gandha, meaning smell. The root has a strong aroma that is described as "horse-like."

In Ayurvedic, Indian, and Unani medicine, ashwagandha is described as "Indian ginseng."  Ashwagandha is also used in traditional African medicine for a variety of ailments.

Don't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry.Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling (inflammation), lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.
Stress. Taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM66, Ixoreal Biomed, Hyderabad, India) 300 mg twice daily after food for 60 days appears to improve symptoms of stress.
Reducing side effects associated with medications called antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia but they can cause levels of fat and sugar in the blood to increase. Taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Cap Strelaxin, M/s Pharmanza Herbal Pvt. Ltd., Gujarat, India) 400 mg three times daily for one month might reduce levels of fat and sugar in the blood in people using these medications.
Anxiety. Some clinical research shows that taking ashwagandha can reduce some symptoms of anxiety or anxious mood.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some clinical research shows that a combination herbal product containing ashwagandha may improve attention and impulse control in children with ADHD. The effect of ashwagandha alone is unclear.
Bipolar disorder. Taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Sensoril, Natreon, Inc., New Bruswick, New Jersey) for 8 weeks might improve brain function in people being treated for bipolar disorder.
A brain condition called cerebellar ataxia. Preliminary research shows that ashwagandha in combination with an alternative form of medicine known as Ayurvedic therapy might improve balance in people with cerebellar ataxia.
Fatigue in people treated for cancer (chemotherapy). Early research suggests taking a specific ashwagandha extract 2,000 mg (Himalaya Drug Co, New Delhi, India) during chemotherapy treatment might reduce feelings of tiredness.
Diabetes. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.
High cholesterol. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might reduce cholesterol levels in patients with high cholesterol.
Male infertility. Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that ashwagandha might improve sperm quality, but not sperm count, in infertile men. It is not known if taking ashwagandha can actually improve fertility.
Arthritis. There is preliminary research that ashwagandha taken in a particular supplement (Articulin-F) along with other ingredients might improve arthritis symptoms.  The impact of ashwagandha alone in osteoarthritis is unclear.
Parkinson's disease.  Preliminary research suggests that a combination of herbs including ashwagandha improves Parkinson's symptoms. The effect of ashwagandha alone in Parkinson's is unknown.
Altering immune  system function.
Fibromyalgia.
Inducing vomiting.
Liver problems.
Preventing the signs of aging.
Swelling (inflammation).
Tumors.
Tuberculosis.
Ulcerations.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of ashwagandha for these uses.Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate (detailed description of each of the ratings).Ashwagandha is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth short-term. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known. Large doses of ashwagandha might cause stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting.

It's not known whether it's safe to apply ashwagandha directly to the skin.


       
Diabetes: Ashwagandha might lower blood sugar levels. This could interfere with medications used for diabetes and cause blood sugar levels to go to low. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar closely.
High or low blood pressure: Ashwagandha might decrease blood pressure. This could cause blood pressure to go to low in people with low blood pressure; or interfere with medications used to treat high blood pressure. Ashwagandha should be used cautiously if you have low blood pressure or take medications for your blood pressure.
Stomach ulcers: Ashwagandha can irritate the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Don't use ashwagandha if you have a stomach ulcer.
"Auto-immune diseases" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Ashwagandha might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using ashwagandha.
Surgery: Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system. Healthcare  providers worry that anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery might increase this effect. Stop taking ashwagandha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Thyroid disorders: Ashwagandha might increase thyroid hormone levels. Ashwagandha should be used cautiously or avoided if you have a thyroid condition or take thyroid hormone medications.Ashwagandha might decrease blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications are also used to lower blood sugar. Taking ashwagandha along with diabetes medications might cause your blood sugar to go too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely. The dose of your diabetes medication might need to be changed.

Some medications used for diabetes include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, metformin (Glucophage), pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), tolbutamide (Orinase), and others.Ashwagandha might lower blood pressure. Taking ashwagandha with medications used to treat high blood pressure might cause blood pressure levels to go to low.

Some medications for high blood pressure include captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan), diltiazem (Cardizem), amlodipine (Norvasc), hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL), furosemide (Lasix), and many others.Ashwagandha seems to make the immune system more active. Taking ashwagandha along with medications that decrease the immune system might decrease the effectiveness of these medications.

Some medications that decrease the immune system include azathioprine (Imuran), basiliximab (Simulect), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), daclizumab (Zenapax), muromonab-CD3 (OKT3, Orthoclone OKT3), mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone), corticosteroids (glucocorticoids), and others.Ashwagandha might cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Drugs that cause sleepiness and drowsiness are called sedatives. Taking ashwagandha along with sedative medications might cause too much sleepiness.

Some of these sedative medications include clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), alprazolam (Xanax), flurazepam (Dalmane), midazolam (Versed), and others.Ashwagandha might cause sleepiness and drowsiness. Medications that cause sleepiness are called sedatives. Taking ashwagandha along with sedative medications might cause too much sleepiness.

Some sedative medications include clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), phenobarbital (Donnatal), zolpidem (Ambien), and others.The body naturally produces thyroid hormones. Ashwagandha might increase how much thyroid hormone the body produces. Taking ashwagandha with thyroid hormone pills might cause too much thyroid hormone in the body, and increase the effects and side effects of thyroid hormone.BY MOUTH:

It can help you relax and reduce swelling.Some lab studies show that it can slow the growth of cancer cells, but this effect has not been observed in humans.Ashwagandha is used:It’s generally safe to use ashwagandha in food and tea. However, talk with your healthcare providers before taking supplements or higher amounts of ashwagandha. Supplements are stronger than the herbs you would use in cooking.Ashwagandha can also interact with some medications and affect how they work. For more information, read the “What else do I need to know?” section below.Side effects of using ashwagandha may include:A popular Ayurvedic herb, ashwagandha is often used in formulations prescribed for stress, strain, fatigue, pain, skin diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy (1). It is also used as a general tonic to improve energy levels, health, and longevity (2), and topically as an analgesic (3). Active constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides.Ashwagandha has neuroprotective (26) (37) and anti-inflammatory properties which may protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis (4). It also improved hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity in a murine model of type 2 diabetes (5). Other studies indicate cytotoxic, immunomodulating (8), chemopreventive (1) and radiosensitizing effects (10), and enhancement in chromosomal stability (11).Small studies suggest ashwagandha may promote growth, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell count in children (2), improve sexual health (2) (61), male infertility (27), and relieve mild to moderate climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women (59).  Findings also indicate that it relieves anxiety (23) (54) and stress (52) (62) (63), with a systematic review/dose-response meta-analysis citing the need for high-quality evidence (64). Additional studies showed improvements in both non-restorative sleep in healthy adults (55) and sleep quality in patients with insomnia (51) (56). In patients with schizophrenia, adjunctive use improved symptoms and stress (43) (50), and affected markers of metabolic syndrome (34). Preliminary data suggest improvements in measures of cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder (35) and balance in patients with progressive degenerative cerebral ataxias (24). Ashwagandha formulations were also shown to benefit patients with osteoarthritis (13) and produced analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondro-protective effects in those with knee joint pain (41).Ashwagandha also showed anticancer effects against several cancer cell lines (6) (7), but was ineffective against drug-resistant cancer stem cells (36). It prevented chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in a murine model (12), and the compound Withaferin A enhanced oxaliplatin effects in human pancreatic cancer cells (38). In a small trial of breast cancer patients, ashwagandha alleviated chemotherapy-induced fatigue and improved quality of life (31). Confirmatory research is needed.Ashwagandha may increase testosterone levels and therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer should consult their physicians before taking it (48).Alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides are considered the biologically active components of ashwagandha. Anti-arthritic effects are attributed to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.In animal studies, anti-inflammatory activity by ashwagandha was comparable to hydrocortisone (15). Brain antioxidant effects and CNS tranquilizing effects may be due to influences on GABA receptor function (2) (17). Withanolides in the roots and leaves are considered similar to steroids in their biological activities (41). Triethylene glycol, a compound isolated from the leaves, was identified as an active sleep-inducing component in a murine model, and may potentially be used to relieve insomnia (42).Microarray analysis revealed that ashwagandha represses proinflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, Hsp70, and STAT-2, and induces p38/MAPK expression in a prostate cancer cell line (16). Ashwagandha may inhibit tumor growth (1) (21) and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte production (8). In vitro studies show that root extracts have cytotoxic properties against lung, colon, CNS, and breast cancer cell lines (6). Withaferin A induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disruption of mitochondrial function in a human leukemia cell line, thereby inducing apoptosis (18). In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, withaferin A induced apoptosis and decreased tumor size (19). Apoptosis of cancer cells by withanone is mediated through p53 (7). Withianone also exerts anticancer activity by binding to the TPX2-Aurora A Complex (29). Other studies show ashwagandha cytotoxicity is related to its structure. It enhances ATPase and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase activities, impairing oxidative phosphorylation.In animal studies, ashwagandha enhanced radiation therapy effects (20) by reducing tumor GSH levels (10), and reversed paclitaxel-induced neutropenia in mice (12). No significant interactions have been reported between ashwagandha and either CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 enzymes in human liver microsomes (40).Commonly reported effects: Mild to moderate and transient drowsiness, upper GI discomfort, loose stools (43) (53)Less common effects reported: Giddiness, drowsiness, hallucinogenic, vertigo, nasal congestion (rhinitis), cough, cold, decreased appetite, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, hyperactivity, nocturnal cramps, blurring of vision, hyperacidity, skin rash and weight gain (53)Case reportsA few preliminary studies suggest ashwagandha may help reduce stress, anxiety, and fatigue, but larger studies are needed. 
Ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng, is a popular Ayurvedic herb and considered a tonic with multiple properties. In the lab, ashwagandha has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and relax the central nervous system in animals. Other experiments suggest it can enhance immune cells and impair or kill cancer cells, but more studies are needed to determine whether these effects can occur in humans. Clinical trials suggest ashwagandha may help reduce anxiety, stress, and fatigue, but larger studies are needed.Ashwagandha may affect certain lab tests that measure thyroid functioning and digoxin levels.

      Literally just like taking a Xanax or Ativan. 

Contains the exact same ingredients of pain killers, anxiety pills, and sleep pills all rolled into a brown capsule of dried plant.

It's wonderful for anxiety and insomnia- but it's not something to play with!As a man, I noticed a great upgrade in my libido. More energy during my day. With a higher dose, I can definetly feel the substance in my body giving me energy to go through the day. Also take during a meal to avois stomach upset. Did not notice a change in my anxiety however, I think? Try it for yourself, everyone's body reacts differently.After three days I went from high blood pressure to low. I had to cut my blood pressure pills in half. But I will mention I was also dieting and working out more. And I have lost a few pounds. IF I can get off blood pressure altogether, that would be awesome.on my 3rd bottle (90 caps of 450 mg) usually i take twice daily one after breakfast/lunch and one after dinner . Taking 3 times when needed.

i struggle with high anxiety , uncontrolled anger esp. during PMS and also insomnia

This helped me alot. centered my emotions, clearer mindset, more focused, helped to be more calm and collected when confronted with triggering situations and sleep was better

no other side effects noted in my experience ( with maximum dose of 450 mg x 3 daily )I've found this supplement extremely effective. So much so that I only take two tablets when I want novel effects for just one day. The most noticeable effect is a quieting of the mind. I feel more sleepy, more comfy, but not tiered, not low energy, just cool and collected â everything comes to me in a timely manner and I want to cuddle people.

My satisfaction is somewhat lower than the effectiveness as though it clearly has a good effect on anxiety, it also decreases my desire to talk and share passionately â which I also love. So though it makes me very comfortable in the room with many people, I cease to be life of the party â though that wasn't happening anyway.

I simply reserve this analog for when I want a different colour spilled over the day. A fantastic novel effect which can help stimulate the fulfilment of your week.Read More Read Less  I tried a 150mg ksm-66 gummy. I ate it around 4:30pm. By 5:15 I was feeling some heaviness in my chest and my legs were more wobbly than with my everyday anxiety. By 6:30 I had lost my appetite, felt shaky, and had been in my bathroom peeing for 45minutes. Its now 915 and I feel nausea (been feeling like I was going to puke at any moment) and feeling a little more tired from it all. Hopefully I will get over all this soon!I have been taking it for about 3 months and it has had the most amazing effect on treating my chronic anxiety and burnout. I have started by taking 800mg/day and now I can do with 400mg/day. I have suggested it to everyone I know and all of them speak highly of it, as if it's some kind of miracle treatment. Well, for me it is! 

Just a FYY, if you have gastrointestinal issues such as acid reflux, gerd, stomach ulcers, you might want to take only 400mg/day and on a full stomach, otherwise it might cause some discomfort. 
Not sure about taking it longterm, I haven't had issues with it and I know someone that's been taking it for over a year with the same positive results. Might just be a case of "there are not any proper long-term studies on its effects". Good luck!Read More Read Less  these gummies made me so sick. I've been throwing up at night within an hour of taking them.I started supplementing with a powder in my coffee, in an attempt to help balance my body from an array of symptoms relating to hormonal imbalance when recovering from stopping hormonal birth control nearly 2 years ago. I took a powder from a health food store. Unfortunately it has taken me over a year to connect the dots and realize the ashwaghanda I incorporated into my natural treatments was then the culprit of some of the very symptoms I was trying to combat. Namely: low/no sex drive, being completely emotionally numb, extreme fatigue, debililtating brainfog. I will say it can lower anxiety, but along with this lowers my ability to feel any emotion at all and during acute stage I felt like a complete zombie, and had zero motivation. This affects so many hormones (is GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, affects your sex hormones, drastically lowers cortisol) The strong effect on all of this resulted in persistent and impactful imbalance eg: you really, really need cortisol..at the correct levels, to feel motivated and content emotionally) Yes I cycled it, and took half a teaspoon on the days I had it, a common recommendation. It wasn't til I restocked and commenced a new cycle nearly every day for 3 weeks (in January this year) that I noticed something was really, really wrong.. It does not work well with my, and many others' bodies. I have now been 2.5 months off so far and the extreme fatigue, brainfog, demotivation, and feeling dead inside have subsided (they were practically debilitating and I have lost a lot of my life to this supplement making me sick). I am becoming much more alert, my menstrual cycle is no longer extremely short like 21 days, I still can't feel all my emotions, nor is my sex drive working and that is significant, beyond having sex. Sexual energy is a life force, the feeling of embodiment. Whereas I am dissociated. I am 30 and know myself very, very well and this is distinctly an imbalance my body/brain are trying to recover from- my thoughts themselves are not negative. I literally can't feel my emotions. This really is not for everyone, please be careful and know that as an ayurvedic herb act very differently on each person depending on their energetic/biological make up and it would be best assessed and monitored by a qualified practitioner of herbal medicine. The consistency of use may also vary a lot per person, IF you're suited to use it, Too many people take this with bare minimum information. It is a drug, and it can have significant, lasting effects that are very detrimental. Be very carefulRead More Read Less  Took 1 concentrated 125 mg dose. Within 12 hours I began having a pretty bad stomach ache. 5 hours later I was throwing up. I couldnât sleep that night because my heart rate was abnormally high. 0/10 do not recommend, or at least, be very cautiousI was having a slight case of Anxiety due to job related issues, so I decided to look up a mood enhancing suplement online. That's when I ran into a company selling Ashwagandha on Amazon. The first day I took this I did not feel anything at all. It sort of reminded me of St. John Wort the bottle which has been sitting on my shelf for 5 years with minimal use except as a Placebo. In any case, I didn't want to give up, so I took it for another few days. By the 4th day my Anxiety had become more accute. I also had problems sleeping. It was like my mind was racing and I could not crontrol the recurring thoughts. I actually felt Synapses and Neurons going off in my brain like a July 4th fire-works celebration ! This is the second (and definitely the last time time) I had this reaction with Ashwagandha. At least the St Johns Wort didn't keep me from sleeping. This supplement is just not for me ..   Read More Read Less  Notice a marked difference in anxiety levels when taking as directed.  When taken anxiety level is greatly reduced.BEWARE OF ASHWAGANDHA if you have autoimmune issues or take blood pressure medication.  I spent 1 1/2 years suffering long haul covid symptoms of light headedness and fatigue but finally got better.  Many supplements that I've been taking may have helped me.  I received a free, unsolicited bottle of Ashwagandha in the mail from a supplier of another supplement that I was using.  I happened to open the package at the time I was taking my other supplements so thought that I would try it.  Within fifteen minutes of taking it, I got light headed and this lasted through the day and now into the next morning as I write this. I also have fatigue.  I later saw on WebMD that you should avoid Ashwagandha if you have autoimmune issues or take blood pressure medication (which both apply to me).  I am very concerned that Ashwagandha has resurrected my long haul covid symptoms and dearly hope that this is just temporary.Read More Read Less  While it may be a placebo effect, I do feel different after starting a daily regime of 4400mg of Ashwagandha in gummy form along with regular daily vitamins and my daily prescribed 80mg of Adderal. I did experience stomach discomfort at the end of the first week at a 4400mg dosage, reduced it to a 2200mg daily dosage for 7 days, which eliminated the stomach problems, then returned to 4400mg without further problems.

At the time with ashwaganda 
Started taking ashwaganda for anxiety, after 3 weeks of use I sleep much better, my hormones got much better, even my blood pressure, Iâm 42 years old tried to get pregnant for years and after I started taking it with 42 I got pregnant, crazy , but I know was the ashwaganda Caused me extreme nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Started with capsules 3000 MG, thought it must be too high dosage. Switched to 1500 MG gummies, same effect.  I am unable to tolerate it.I started very slowly on liquid ashwaganda, just a few drops. We were boating and heading into a remote area. Just a few drops and my anxious thoughts disappeared. I was able to enjoy myself. I have been adjusting my dosage up over a few years. I love the liquid for instant results, but have started taking Herbamama capsules 750 mg for longer lasting effects. (Amazon) I am able to travel and not be anxious. Life changing for me. I do find that I am not as sharp when taking Ashwaganda, so I only take as needed, not everyday. I love that I can rely on a natural remedy and not prescription drugs. No side effects, havenât had a bad experience.Read More Read Less  Could this be serotonin syndrome? Iâve been having trouble falling asleep lately despite meds Iâve taken for a long time for depression/anxiety, so decided to try adding Ashwaganda, since it was reported to calm a racing mind. Took 300 mg in gummy form (Walgreens), and itâs had the OPPOSITE effect. I feel anxious, jittery, my mind wonât stop racing and Iâve barely had 2 hrs sleep in 48 hours. I wonder if it interacts with my SSRI to cause serotonin syndrome? Iâm stopping it right away and hope it clears my system soon so I can get some sleep! Be very cautious with this if you are taking other meds for psychiatric conditions.Read More Read Less   Do you know your vitamin ABCs?  Ease hot flashes and other symptoms.  Are you getting enough?

Some research suggests this herb may help people with conditions like anxiety and infertility, but stronger studies are needed.Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, which is a traditional form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.People have used ashwagandha for thousands of years to relieve stress, increase energy levels, and improve concentration.“Ashwagandha” is Sanskrit for “smell of the horse,” which refers to both the herb’s scent and its potential ability to increase strength.Its botanical name is Withania somnifera, and it’s also known by several other names, including “Indian ginseng” and “winter cherry.”The ashwagandha plant is a small shrub with yellow flowers that’s native to India and Southeast Asia. People use extracts or powder from the plant’s root or leaves to treat a variety of conditions, including anxiety and fertility issues.Here are 8 potential benefits of ashwagandha, based on research.Ashwagandha is perhaps best known for its ability to reduce stress. It’s classified as an adaptogen, a substance that helps the body cope with stress.Ashwagandha may help control mediators of stress, including heat shock proteins (Hsp70), cortisol, and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK-1). It also reduces the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system in your body that regulates the stress response.Research suggests Ashwagandha supplements may help relieve stress and anxiety.In a small study with 58 participants, those who took 250 or 600 mg of ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks had significantly reduced perceived stress and levels of the stress hormone cortisol compared with those who took a placebo.Those who took the ashwagandha supplements also saw improvements in sleep quality compared with the placebo group.Another study in 60 people found that those who took 240 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 60 days had significant reductions in anxiety compared with those who received a placebo treatment. Thus, early research suggests ashwagandha may be a helpful supplement for stress and anxiety.However, a 2021 review of studies concluded that there’s not enough evidence to form a consensus on the most appropriate dosage and form of ashwagandha for treating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety. Ashwagandha may be effective for reducing stress and anxiety symptoms. However, more research is needed to form a consensus on appropriate forms and dosing to address stress and stress-related disorders. Research has shown that ashwagandha may have beneficial effects on athletic performance and may be a worthwhile supplement for athletes. One analysis of research included 12 studies in people who took ashwagandha doses between 120 mg and 1,250 mg per day. The results suggest the herb may enhance physical performance, including strength and oxygen use during exercise.Another analysis that looked at five studies found that taking ashwagandha significantly enhanced maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) in healthy adults and athletes.VO2 max is the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use during intense activity. It’s a measurement of heart and lung fitness.Having optimal VO2 max is important for athletes and nonathletes alike. Low VO2 max is associated with increased mortality risk, while higher VO2 max is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.Additionally, ashwagandha may help increase muscle strength.In a 2015 study, male participants who took 600 mg of ashwagandha per day and participated in resistance training for 8 weeks had significantly greater gains in muscle strength and size compared with a placebo group.Ashwagandha may help improve measures of physical performance in athletes and healthy adults, including VO2 max and strength.Some evidence suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of other mental health conditions, including depression, in certain populations.In one study, researchers looked at the effects of ashwagandha in 66 people with schizophrenia who were experiencing depression and anxiety.They found that participants who took 1,000 mg of ashwagandha extract daily for 12 weeks had greater reductions in depression and anxiety than those who took a placebo.Limited research from 2013 also suggests that ashwagandha may help improve cognitive impairment in people with bipolar disorder.A 2021 review concluded that ashwaghanda may help manage depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other mental health-related and neurological issues.However, more research is needed into all these uses.The limited research available suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of depression and benefit people with some mental health conditions. However, more research is needed.Ashwagandha supplements have been shown in some studies to benefit male fertility and increase testosterone levels. In one study, 43 males aged 40–70 with overweight and mild fatigue took tablets containing ashwagandha extract or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. The treatment was associated with an 18% greater increase in DHEA-S, a sex hormone involved in testosterone production. Participants who took the herb also had a 14.7% greater increase in testosterone than those who took the placebo.Additionally, a review of four studies found that ashwagandha treatment significantly increased sperm concentration, semen volume, and sperm motility in males with low sperm count.It also increased sperm concentration and motility in males with normal sperm count.However, more studies are needed.Ashwagandha may help increase testosterone levels and may have some potential benefits for male fertility. However, more research is needed.Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may have some benefits for people with diabetes or high blood sugar levels.A review of 24 studies, including 5 clinical studies in people with diabetes, found that treatment with ashwagandha significantly reduced blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, blood lipids, and oxidative stress markers. The reason may be that certain compounds within ashwagandha — including one called withaferin A (WA) — have powerful antidiabetic activity and may help stimulate cells to take in glucose from the bloodstream.However, research is limited at this time, and more well-designed studies are needed.Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may reduce blood sugar levels through its effects on insulin secretion and cells’ ability to absorb glucose from the bloodstream.Ashwagandha contains compounds, including WA, that may help reduce inflammation in the body.Animal studies have shown that WA may also help reduce levels of inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and there’s some evidence ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in humans too.In a 2021 study, researchers gave people with COVID-19 an Ayurvedic drug containing 0.5 grams of ashwagandha and other herbs twice per day for 7 days. This reduced participants’ levels of inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α compared with a placebo.The treatment formulation also contained:However, research on ashwagandha’s potential effects on inflammation remain limited. Ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in the body. However, more research is needed.Taking ashwagandha may benefit cognitive function.One review of five clinical studies found early evidence that ashwagandha could improve cognitive functioning in certain populations, including older adults with mild cognitive impairment and people with schizophrenia.Cognitive functions it may benefit included:A study in 50 adults showed that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 8 weeks led to significant improvements in the following measures compared with taking a placebo:The researchers noted that compounds found in ashwagandha, including WA, have antioxidant effects in the brain, which may benefit cognitive health.However, more research is needed before experts can draw strong conclusions. Ashwagandha supplements may improve memory, reaction time, and the ability to perform tasks in certain populations. However, more research is needed.Many people take ashwagandha to promote restful sleep, and some evidence suggests it may help with sleep issues.For example, a study in 50 adults ages 65–80 found that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha root per day for 12 weeks significantly improved sleep quality and mental alertness upon waking compared with a placebo treatment. Additionally, one review of five high quality studies found that ashwagandha appeared to: The results were more pronounced in people with insomnia and in those who took more than 600 mg daily for 8 weeks or longer.Recent evidence suggests that ashwagandha may be an effective natural remedy to improve sleep and may especially help people with insomnia.Ashwagandha is likely safe for most people when used for up to 3 months, although its long-term effects are unknown.However, ashwagandha may not be safe if a person: Some people using ashwagandha supplements have reported the following adverse effects:Ashwagandha’s effects may not be immediate, and you may have to take it for several months before noticing its effects. Always speak with a doctor to ensure ashwagandha or other supplements are safe for you to use.Dosing recommendations for ashwagandha vary. For example, research has shown doses ranging from 250–1,250 mg per day to to be effective for different conditions. Consult a healthcare professional if you have questions regarding ashwagandha dosing. You can take ashwagandha in many ways, in either a single dose or multiple doses per day. And you can take it either with meals or on an empty stomach.How much ashwagandha can you take per day? Find out more.Although ashwagandha is safe for most people, it’s not safe for everyone. It’s important to check with a healthcare professional before taking ashwagandha to ensure it’s safe for you and that you use a safe dose.Possible benefits of ashwagandha include:The effects of ashwagandha will take time to appear, so a healthcare professional may recommend taking one dose daily. However, the long-term effects are unknown, and experts only recommend using it for up to 3 months. Ashwagangandha may not be safe:Always check with a healthcare professional before using ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb with various possible health benefits.Study findings suggest that it may help reduce anxiety and stress, support restful sleep, and even improve cognitive functioning in certain populations.Ashwagandha is likely safe for most people in the short term.

Masala chai (/tʃaɪ/, lit. 'mixed-spice tea'; Hindi: मसाला चाय; Urdu: مصالحہ چائے) is a popular beverage throughout South Asia, originating in early modern Indian subcontinent. Chai is made by brewing black tea (usually CTC tea) in milk and water and then sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and spices creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced.[2][3]
The term chai originated from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (चाय). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as masala chai,[4] or simply chai,[5] even though the term refers to tea in general in the original language. 
Originating in India[1][6] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses, with many using the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caffè latte but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. By 1994, the term had gained currency on the U.S. coffeehouse scene.[7]
Tea was introduced to India by the British as a popular beverage. Tea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage.[8]
In the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around 1 pound (0.45 kg) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in India (50%) and Ceylon (33%), present-day Sri Lanka.[9]
However, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent chaiwalas throughout the growing railway system.[10]
The official promotion of tea was as served in the Indian mode, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, chai in its present form has now firmly established itself as a popular beverage.[11]
Black tea is typically used as base in most chai recipes. The most common type of black tea is Assam; however, a blend of different tea variations may be used.[12] Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri are the three most common types of tea used in chai in India.[13]
The traditional masala chai is a spiced beverage brewed with different proportions of warming spices. The spice mixture, called karha, uses a base of ground ginger and green cardamom pods. Other spices are usually added to this karha including one or more of cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds, peppercorn, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom seeds, ginger root, honey, vanilla, and other spices.[14][15]
Masala chai in western India often excludes clove and black peppercorn. A small amount of salt is often added to chai in the region of Bhopal.[16] The Kashmiri version of chai is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of spices with a pinch of salt. This version is a bit savory and is pink in color, due to the addition of baking soda.[17]
Traditionally in India, water buffalo milk is used to make chai.[18][19] Although whole milk is usually used in masala chai, alternative dairy milk such as soy milk or skim milk is also a preferred option across the world.[20]
White sugar, brown sugar, Demerara sugar, or honey may be used as sweetener in chai. Jaggery may also be used as a sweetener.[21]
The simplest traditional method of preparing masala chai is through decoction, by actively simmering or boiling a mixture of milk and water with loose-leaf tea, sweeteners, and whole spices. Indian markets all over the world sell various brands of chai masala, (Hindi: चाय मसाला, romanized: chāy masālā, lit. 'tea spice') for this purpose, though many households or tea vendors, known in India as chai wallahs,[22] blend their own. The solid tea and spice residues are strained off from masala chai before serving.
A common Maharashtrian practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a "tea masala". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, "tea masala" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, lemongrass, cloves, and cinnamon.[23] The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea[24] is added. The chai is immediately taken off the heat, covered, and allowed to sit for about 10 minutes to allow the black tea to infuse into the chai. The chai is then strained and served.
Small vendors (called chaiwalla in Hindi/cha-ola in Bengali) are found by the side of every highway, road and alley – often the only establishments that will be open through the night. They generally also sell tobacco and snacks. Many will deliver tea to people's places of business in a chaidaan, a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.[25]
In the metropolitan city of Mumbai, roadside tea stalls serve smaller cups of tea at a lower budget which is referred to as 'cutting chai', the term 'cutting' referring to the halving of quantity contained in a full cup to reduce the cost of the cup of tea.[26]
In Pakistan, masala chai is usually brewed with milk and sweetened with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and/or cloves.[27]
Masala chai is popular in East Africa and the Caribbean.[28][29] It is also quite popular in the GCC; but it is locally known as Karak Tea or Chai Karak (Arabic: شاي كرك, Urdu: کڑک چائے).[30]
In the West, to better simulate water buffalo milk, one may try using dry or powdered milk, along with the raw or turbinado sugar normally used in India. In addition, as milk consumption in all age groups in the West has started to decrease steadily over the last 50 years, substitutes such as oat and almond milk have emerged as an alternative to water buffalo milk as well.[31]
As an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold "chai" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a blender and topped with whipped cream.[32]
Chai with added espresso is  called a  "dirty chai" in America, as well as "java chai", "red eye chai", "turbocharger", "chai charger", "tough guy chai", etc.[33][34]
